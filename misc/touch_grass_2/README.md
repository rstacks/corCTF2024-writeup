- This challenge requires us to, quite literally, touch grass. I opened the website
on my phone and allowed it to access my location. I was then given a few actual locations
near me to choose from.

- I chose a park close to my house. To get the flag, I needed to go outside and walk to the park.
I don't have photographic evidence (for obvious reasons), but I can assure you that I did indeed
touch grass. The website updated to the following after I completed my journey, which revealed
the flag:
